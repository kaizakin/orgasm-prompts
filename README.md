## Make LLM's orgasm with these prompts

- [you want to get started and understand the flow of a open source repo](cursor/prompt.md#when-you-want-to-get-started-and-understand-the-flow-of-a-open-source-repo)
- [you're new to a monorepo which is complex and you wanna take a peek](cursor/prompt.md#when-youre-new-to-a-monorepo-which-is-complex-and-you-wanna-take-a-peek)

---

Use these prompts to efficiently tell LLM's what you want beforehand
- This prevents LLM's to not give some random shitty asf responses while you were seeking sth to understand the codebase.
- The key to better prompting is being explicit
- Tell em what exactly you want don't let them decide 
- Be verbose in prompts.

Happy learning!, cheers✌️
