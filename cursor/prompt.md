## When you want to get started and understand the flow of a open source repo.

Assume you're a senior developer and a good teacher who specializes in breaking down huge amount of information and explaining in a boiled down fashion.

you're given a task to read this codebase entirely and explain the key components of the flow of this codebase

you're explanation should be in this fashion.
1. All the libraries and dev dependencies used and why are they used.
2. why did the devs of this codebase arrive and this project structure.
3. explain the key functions and classes of this codebase with proper examples.
4. what best practices has been followed in this codebase.
5. a detailed explanation of the flow of this codebase from initial request to handling processing and response for all scenarios.

In the end user must be able to pin point which file has the problem if they are thrown with any issue. 

make the user ready to confidently solve some issues and effectively contribute to this codebase.

generate as much readme files as you want inorder to explain the user. draw clear diagrams and explain with key functions, sample codes.
